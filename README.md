# Thoughts about code:
### Controller Organization
- The current structure of the `BookingController` as a resource controller appears to have mixed responsibilities, containing numerous methods with business logic. This practice goes against established coding standards.
### Repository Optimization:
- Certain methods within the `BookingController` have their business logic residing in the `BookingRepository`, which also seems to house methods that could benefit from further optimization.

# How would I have done it
### Single Action Controllers
- My recommendation is to refactor the controllers to adhere to the single-action principle. Each action should have its dedicated route and controller. Although I have not updated the controller methods in the provided code, creating separate controllers for each action can significantly enhance organization.
### Services with Interfaces and Repositories
- I have introduced services with interfaces alongside repositories to improve the codebase. This approach offers several advantages:
  1. This approach makes code more decoupled reducing dependencies of different components on each other.
  2. Interfaces provide an abstraction layer hiding the implementation details.
  3. When code is decoupled in this way, it gets a lot easier to debug it if the need arise or make changes to it whenever required.
  4. Writing Tests get easier as we can mock interfaces and write tests for each component separately.
  5. Following a standard approach makes the code more readable and easier for other team members to understand which results in more convenient collaboration.
### Strict Typing and Type Hinting:
- To further strengthen the codebase, I suggest implementing strict typing and utilizing type hinting where applicable. This proactive approach helps prevent runtime errors and contributes to a more robust system.
### Early Return Pattern
- Some of the methods contain complex business logic having lots of conditions. I have implemented Early Return Pattern in one of the methods as it makes code easier to read and understand. It helps avoid unnecessary indentation levels and makes the code more straightforward.
### Final Remarks
- I have implemented the above points to the codebase and added details to show my approach when coding in actual projects.
